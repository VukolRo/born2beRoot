### born2beRoot         
  My fourth project in "school 21". I created a server using VirtualBox. OS - Debian.      
               
Steps:
1. [Created](https://github.com/VukolRo/born2beRoot/blob/main/Installation_of_Debian.md) a virtual machine using VirtualBox and installed there Debian OS. Graphical interface is forbidden.
2. [Installed](https://github.com/VukolRo/born2beRoot/blob/main/packages.md) required packages for managing the server.
3. [Created](https://github.com/VukolRo/born2beRoot/blob/main/monitoring_script.md) the [script](https://github.com/VukolRo/born2beRoot/blob/main/monitoring.sh) for monitoring current state of the server.
4. [Created](https://github.com/VukolRo/born2beRoot/blob/main/passwd_policy.md) a strong password policy.
